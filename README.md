# Empirical Analysis Project

## 🚀 Project Description
This project focuses on **Predicting Loan Default Using Financial and Demographic Data**. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes patterns in loan data to assess the likelihood of default. The dataset includes key financial indicators, borrower details, and loan repayment history.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- 🔎 **Feature Engineering**: Feature scaling and categorical encoding to improve model performance.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.
- 🏆 **Performance Evaluation**: Model assessment using accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
- 📈 **Visualization**: Graphical representation of loan patterns, risk factors, and model performance.

## 📦 Installation & Setup
